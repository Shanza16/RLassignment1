# Bandit Learning Algorithms – Assignment Report

This repository contains solutions to a reinforcement learning assignment focused on bandit algorithms. The goal is to evaluate and compare various strategies for solving the multi-armed bandit problem under different settings, including stationary and non-stationary environments.



## Contents

- `Part1.ipynb` – Implementation of basic bandit algorithms
- `Part1-comparison.ipynb` – Comparison across Greedy, ε-Greedy, Optimistic, and Gradient Bandit methods
- `Part2-Gradual changes.ipynb` – Handling non-stationary rewards with drift and mean-reverting updates
- `Part2-Abrupt.ipynb` – Response to abrupt environment changes (permutation at t = 501)


## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## How to Run

Launch Jupyter and open each `.ipynb` file:

```bash
jupyter notebook
